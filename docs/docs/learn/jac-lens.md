## Setup for Jac Cloud (Pre-0.2.5)

If you're using Jac Cloud version prior to 0.2.5, you need to manually add the required walkers to your application.

### Required Walkers

Create a file named `jaclens.jac` with the following content:

```jac
walker get_attached_nodes {
    has node_id: str = "";
    can get_attach_nodes with `root entry {
        if(self.node_id == "") {
            report jid(here);
        } else {
            selected_node = &self.node_id;
            attached_nodes = [selected_node-->];
            report attached_nodes;
        }
    }
}

walker update_node_data {
    has node_id: str = "";
    has node_data: dict = {};
    can update_node_data with `root entry {
        selected_node = &self.node_id;
        selected_node.__dict__.update(self.node_data);
        report selected_node;
    }
}
```

### Integration Steps

1. **Create the file** `jaclens.jac` in your project
2. **Copy the walker code** above into the file
3. **Include in your main file** by adding `include jaclens;` at the top of your application entry JAC file

??? info "Why These Walkers?"
    These walkers provide the necessary functionality for Jac Lens to:
    - Retrieve node information and relationships
    - Update node properties in real-time
    - Navigate through your graph structure

## Using Jac Lens

### 1. Server Connection

Connect to your Jac server by providing:

- **Host URL**: Your Jac server address (remove trailing slash)
- **Email**: Your account email
- **Password**: Your account password

??? example "Example Connection"
    ```
Host URL: https://my-jac-server.com
    Email: user@example.com
    Password: ********
    ```

### 2. Graph Navigation

Once connected, you can explore your graph:

- **Click on nodes** to view their properties
- **Navigate connections** between nodes
- **Zoom and pan** to explore large graphs
- **Search for specific nodes** using the search functionality

### 3. Node Management

Modify node properties directly in the interface:

- **Edit node attributes** in the side panel
- **Save changes** to update your server
- **View node relationships** and connections
- **Delete nodes** when needed

### 4. Session Management

Jac Lens automatically manages your sessions:

- **Automatic saving** of your current view
- **Session persistence** across browser sessions
- **Resume where you left off** when returning to the app
