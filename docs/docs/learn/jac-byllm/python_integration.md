# byLLM as a Library for Python

The byLLM module is a Jaclang plugin that provides AI functionality. Since Jaclang supersets Python, byLLM can be integrated into Python applications. This guide demonstrates how to use byLLM in Python.

byLLM is a Python package that needs to be installed using:

```bash
pip install byllm
```

There are two modes of using byLLM in python.

1. [Import byLLM library into Python.](python_integration.md#1-importing-byllm-in-python)
2. [Write AI feature in Jac with byLLM plugin, and import the jac module into Python. (**Recomended**)](python_integration.md#2-implement-in-jac-then-import-to-python)

## 1. Importing byLLM in Python

byLLM functionality is accessed by importing the `byllm` module and using the `by` decorator on functions.

```python linenums="1"
import jaclang
from dataclasses import dataclass
from byllm.lib import Model, Image, by

llm = Model(model_name="gpt-4o")

@dataclass
class Person:
    full_name: str
    description: str
    year_of_birth: int


@by(llm)
def get_person_info(img: Image) -> Person: ...

img = Image("https://bricknellschool.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/einstein3.webp")

person = get_person_info(img)
print(f"Name: {person.full_name}, Description: {person.description}, Year of Birth: {person.year_of_birth}")
```

??? example "NOTE:"
    Here byLLM can only use primitive types and dataclasses as input and output types. We are working to resolve this limitation.

### Model Hyper-parameters

In Jaclang, hyper-parameters are set by passing them to the LLM model:

```jac linenums="1"
import from byllm.lib { Model }

glob llm = Model(model_name="gpt-4o")

def generate_joke() -> str by llm(temperature=0.3);
```

The `temperature` hyper-parameter controls the randomness of the output. Lower values produce more deterministic output, while higher values produce more random output.

In Python, hyper-parameters are passed as follows:

```python linenums="1"
import jaclang
from byllm.lib import Model, by

llm = Model(model_name="gpt-4o")

@by(llm(temperature=0.3))
def generate_joke() -> str: ...
```

### Using Python Functions as Tools

Python functions can be used as tools in byLLM. Functions defined in Python are callable by the LLM to perform specific tasks:

```python linenums="1"
import jaclang
from byllm.lib import Model
llm = Model(model_name="gpt-4o")


def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."

@by(llm(tools=[get_weather]))
def answer_question(question: str) -> str: ...
```

### Using Semstrings for Semantic Enrichment

In Jac we introduced the `sem` keyword as a means to attach additional semantics to code objects such as object attributes and function argument. The syntax in jac is as follows.

```jac
obj Person {
    has name:str;
    has age:int;
    has ssn: int;
}
sem Person.ssn = "last four digits of the Social Security number"
```

Using `sem` functionality in python is a bit diferent as the attachment is done using a `@sem` decorator.

```python
from jaclang import JacRuntimeInterface as Jac
from byllm.lib import Model, by

@Jac.sem('<Person Semstring>', {
    'name' : '<name semstring>',
    'age' : '<age semstring>',
    'ssn' : "<ssn semstring>"
    }
)
@datclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    ssn: int
```

!!! note
    The `sem` implementation in Python is a work-in-progress. The Python way of adding semstrings may change in future releases of byLLM.

## 2. Implement in Jac, then import to Python

It is recomended to implement the AI features purely in jaclang and just import the module into python, seamlessly. This feature is allowed through jaclang's mechanism for [supersetting python](../../learn/superset_python.md#seamless-interoperability-import-jac-files-like-python-modules).

=== "main.py"
    ```python linenums="1"
    import jaclang
    from .ai import Image, Person, get_person_info

    img = Image("https://bricknellschool.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/einstein3.webp")

    person = get_person_info(img)
    print(f"Name: {person.full_name}, Description: {person.description}, Year of Birth: {person.year_of_birth}")
    ```
=== "ai.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    import from byllm.lib {Model, Image}

    glob llm = Model(model_name="gpt-4o");

    obj Person{
        has full_name: str;
        has description: str;
        has year_of_birth: int;
    }

    sem Person.description = "Short biography"

    def get_person_info(img: Image) -> Person by llm();
    ```
