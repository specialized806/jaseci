# <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold">Jac in a Flash</span>

This mini tutorial uses a single toy program to highlight the major pieces of
the Jac language.  We start with a small Python game and gradually evolve it
into a fully object‑spatial Jac implementation.  Each iteration introduces a new
Jac feature while keeping the overall behaviour identical.

## Step&nbsp;0 – The Python version

Our starting point is a regular Python program that implements a simple "guess
the number" game.  The player has several attempts to guess a randomly generated
number.

=== "guess_game.py"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game.py"
    ```

## Step&nbsp;1 – A direct Jac translation

`guess_game1.jac` mirrors the Python code almost line for line.  Classes are
declared with `obj` and methods with `def`.  Statements end with a semicolon and
the parent initializer is invoked via `super.init`.  Program execution happens
inside a `with entry { ... }` block, which replaces Python's
`if __name__ == "__main__":` section.  This step shows how familiar Python
concepts map directly to Jac syntax.

=== "guess_game1.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game1.jac"
    ```
=== "Try it"
    <div class="code-block">
    ```jac
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game1.jac"
    ```
    </div>

## Step&nbsp;2 – Declaring fields with `has`

The second version moves attribute definitions into the class body using the
`has` keyword.  Fields may specify types and default values directly on the
declaration.  Methods that take no parameters omit parentheses in their
signature, making the object definition concise.

=== "guess_game2.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game2.jac"
    ```
=== "Try it"
    <div class="code-block">
    ```jac
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game2.jac"
    ```
    </div>

## Step&nbsp;3 – Separating implementation with `impl`

The fourth version splits object declarations from their implementations using
`impl`.  The object lists method signatures (`def init;`, `override def play;`),
and the actual bodies are provided later in `impl Class.method` blocks.  This
separation keeps the interface clean and helps organise larger codebases.

=== "guess_game3.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game3.jac"
    ```
=== "guess_game3.impl.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game3.impl.jac"
    ```
=== "Try it"
    <div class="code-block">
    ```jac
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game3.jac"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game3.impl.jac"
    ```
    </div>

## Step&nbsp;4 – Walking the graph

Finally `guess_game4.jac` re‑imagines the game using Jac's object‑spatial
architecture.  A `walker` visits a chain of `turn` nodes created with `++>`
edges.  The walker moves with `visit [-->]` and stops via `disengage` when the
guess is correct.  The game is launched by `spawn`ing the walker at `root`.
This example shows how conventional logic can become graph traversal.

=== "guess_game4.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game4.jac"
    ```
=== "guess_game4.impl.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game4.impl.jac"
    ```
=== "Try it"
    <div class="code-block">
    ```jac
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game4.jac"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game4.impl.jac"
    ```
    </div>

## Step&nbsp;5 – Scale Agnostic Approach

The fifth version demonstrates Jac's scale-agnostic design. The same code that runs locally can seamlessly scale to cloud deployment without modification. By running the command `jac serve filename.jac`, the walkers become API endpoints that can be called via HTTP requests. This shows how Jac applications are inherently cloud-ready.

=== "guess_game5.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game5.jac"
    ```
=== "guess_game5.impl.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game5.impl.jac"
    ```
=== "Try it"
    <div class="code-block">
    ```jac
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game5.jac"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game5.impl.jac"
    ```
    </div>

## Step&nbsp;6 – AI-Enhanced Gameplay with byLLM

The final version integrates AI capabilities using byLLM (Meaning Typed LLM). Instead of simple "too high" or "too low" responses, the game now provides intelligent, context-aware hints generated by an LLM. This demonstrates how easily AI can be woven into Jac applications to create more engaging user experiences.

=== "guess_game6.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game6.jac"
    ```
=== "guess_game6.impl.jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "jac/examples/guess_game/guess_game6.impl.jac"
    ```

Happy code deconstructing!
