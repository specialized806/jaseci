# <span style="color: orange">Relative Imports</span>

Relative imports allow modules within a package to reference each other using `.` (current) and `..` (parent) notation.

!!! warning "Prefer Absolute Imports"
    **Relative imports can be ambiguous.** We recommend absolute imports in most cases. Use relative imports only for tightly coupled internal package code.

## Relative Import Syntax

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `.module` | Same directory |
| `..module` | Parent directory |
| `...module` | Grandparent directory |

---

## Same-Level Imports (`.`)

Import from modules in the same directory.

## Mixed Absolute and Relative

You can combine both import styles, but prefer absolute imports for clarity.

!!! warning "Relative Import Boundaries"
    Relative imports only work within packages. You cannot use `..` to escape beyond your project's root.

!!! success "Best Practice"
    **Default to absolute imports.** They're explicit and don't break when you reorganize code.
