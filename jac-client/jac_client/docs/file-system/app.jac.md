# The `app.jac` Entry Point

Every Jac client project **must** have an `app.jac` file. This file serves as the entry point for your application and is required for the build system to work correctly.

## Why `app.jac` is Required

### Entry Point for the Build System

When you run `jac serve app.jac`, the build system:
1. Compiles `app.jac` to JavaScript
2. Generates an entry file (`src/main.js`) that imports your `app` function:
   ```javascript
   import { app as App } from "./app.js";
   ```
3. Renders your app component in the browser

**Without `app.jac`, the build system cannot find your application entry point.**

## The `app()` Function

The `app.jac` file **must** export an `app()` function. This function is:
- The root component of your application
- Automatically imported and rendered by the build system
- The starting point for all your UI components

### Required Structure

Every `app.jac` file must contain:

```jac
cl {
    def app() -> any {
        return <div>
            {/* Your application UI */}
        </div>;
    }
}
```

### Minimal Example

```jac
cl {
    def app() -> any {
        return <div>
            <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        </div>;
    }
}
```

## Key Requirements

1. **File must be named `app.jac`**
   - The build system specifically looks for this filename
   - Located at the root of your project

2. **Must contain `app()` function**
   - Function name must be exactly `app`
   - Must be defined inside a `cl { }` block
   - Must return JSX (HTML-like syntax)

3. **Must be a client function**
   - Defined inside `cl { }` block
   - This ensures it runs in the browser

## Common Mistakes

**Missing `app()` function:**
```jac
# ❌ WRONG - No app() function
cl {
    def HomePage() -> any {
        return <div>Home</div>;
    }
}
```

**Wrong function name:**
```jac
# ❌ WRONG - Function named 'main' instead of 'app'
cl {
    def main() -> any {
        return <div>App</div>;
    }
}
```

**Not in `cl` block:**
```jac
# ❌ WRONG - app() not in cl block
def app() -> any {
    return <div>App</div>;
}
```

## Project Structure

Your project structure should look like this:

```
my-app/
├── app.jac              # ✅ Required entry point
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
└── ...
```

## Running Your App

To start your application:

```bash
jac serve app.jac
```

This command compiles `app.jac`, creates the build entry point, and serves your app at `http://localhost:8000/page/app`.

---

**Remember**: `app.jac` with `app()` function is **required** for every Jac client project. Without it, your application cannot start!
