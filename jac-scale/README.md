# JAC Scale Deployment Guide

## Overview

`jac scale` is a comprehensive deployment and scaling solution for JAC applications that provides three powerful capabilities:

### 1. Multi-Layer Memory Architecture
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for high-speed data access and session management
- **Persistence Storage**: MongoDB for reliable, long-term data storage
- **Optimized Performance**: Intelligent caching strategy to minimize database load and maximize response times

### 2. FastAPI Integration with Swagger Documentation
- Automatically converts JAC walkers and functions into RESTful FastAPI endpoints
- Built-in Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for easy API exploration and testing
- Interactive API interface accessible at `/docs` endpoint

### 3. Kubernetes Deployment & Auto-Scaling
- **Easy Deployment**: One-command deployment to Kubernetes clusters
- **Auto-Scaling**: Scale your application based on demand
- **Database Auto-Provisioning**: Automatically spawns and configures Redis and MongoDB instances
- **Production-Ready**: Built-in health checks, persistent storage, and service discovery

Whether you're developing locally with `jac serve` or deploying to production with `jac scale`, you get the same powerful features with the flexibility to choose your deployment strategy.

## Prerequisites
- kubenetes(K8) installed
    - [Minikube Kubernetes](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fwindows%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2F.exe+download/) (for Windows/Linux)
    - [Docker Desktop with Kubernetes](https://www.docker.com/resources/kubernetes-and-docker/) (alternative for Windows - easier setup)

**Note:** Kubernetes is only needed if you are planning to use the `jac scale` command. If you only want to use `jac serve`, Kubernetes is not required.

## Quick Start: Running the Travel Planner Demo Application

Follow these steps to set up and test the Travel Planner JAC application

### 1. Clone the Jaseci Repository

First, clone the main Jaseci repository which contains JAC and JAC-Scale:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaseci-labs/jaseci.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd jaseci
```

### 2. Create Python Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install JAC and JAC-Scale

Install both packages in editable mode from the cloned repository:

```bash
pip install -e ./jac
pip install -e ./jac-scale
```

### 5. Download the Demo Application

Download the Travel Planner demo application from GitHub:

**Option A: Using Git Clone (Recommended)**

```bash
# Navigate back to parent directory or choose a location
cd ..

# Clone the entire repository
git clone https://github.com/jaseci-labs/Agentic-AI.git

# Navigate to the Travel Planner backend and rename
mv Agentic-AI/Travel_planner/BE traveller
cd traveller
```

**Option B: Download Specific Folder**

If you only want the Travel Planner backend:

```bash
# Navigate back to parent directory
cd ..

# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# For Linux/Mac with Homebrew:
brew install gh

# For Windows with Chocolatey:
choco install gh

# Clone only the specific folder
gh repo clone jaseci-labs/Agentic-AI
mv Agentic-AI/Travel_planner/BE traveller
cd traveller
```

**Option C: Manual Download**

1. Go to https://github.com/jaseci-labs/Agentic-AI/tree/main/Travel_planner/BE
2. Click on the green "Code" button
3. Select "Download ZIP"
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Rename the `BE` folder to `traveller`
6. Navigate into the folder:

```bash
cd traveller
```

### 6. Configure Environment Variables

You should now be in the `traveller` folder. Create a `.env` file:

```bash
# Verify you're in the correct directory
pwd  # Should show path ending in /traveller

# Create .env file
touch .env  # Linux/Mac
# OR
type nul > .env  # Windows CMD
# OR
New-Item .env  # Windows PowerShell
```

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

### 7. Install Demo Application Requirements

```bash
pip install byllm python-dotenv
```

### 8. Run the Application with JAC Serve

To run your application using FastAPI with ShelfStorage (no Kubernetes required):

```bash
jac serve main.jac
```

**What this does:**
- Starts your JAC application as a FastAPI server
- Uses ShelfStorage for persisting anchors (lightweight, file-based storage)
- No database setup required
- Ideal for development and testing

**Access your application:**
- Application: http://localhost:8000
- Swagger Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 9. Set Up Kubernetes (For JAC Scale)

To use `jac scale`, you need Kubernetes installed on your machine.

**Option A: MicroK8 (Windows/Linux/Mac)**
- [Official MicroK8 installation guide](https://microk8s.io/)
- [ubunutu installation guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-a-microk8s-kubernetes-cluster-on-ubuntu-22-04)

**Option B: Docker Desktop with Kubernetes (Windows - Recommended)**
- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop settings (easier setup)

### 10. Deploy with JAC Scale

Once Kubernetes is running, you have two deployment methods:

#### Method A: Deploy Without Building (Faster)

Deploy your application to Kubernetes without building a Docker image:

```bash
jac scale main.jac
```

**What this does:**
- Deploys your JAC application to Kubernetes
- Automatically provisions Redis and MongoDB as persistence storage
- Creates necessary Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, StatefulSets)
- Exposes your application via NodePort

**Access your application:**
- Application: http://localhost:30001
- Swagger Documentation: http://localhost:30001/docs

**Use this when:**
- You want faster deployments without rebuilding
- You're testing configuration changes
- You're in development mode

#### Method B: Build, Push, and Deploy (Production)

Build your application as a Docker container and deploy it:

**Prerequisites:**
1. Create a `Dockerfile` in your `traveller` directory
2. Add Docker credentials to your `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
DOCKER_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username
DOCKER_PASSWORD=your-dockerhub-password-or-token
```

**Deploy with build:**

```bash
jac scale main.jac -b
```

**What this does:**
- Builds a Docker image of your JAC application
- Pushes the image to DockerHub
- Deploys the image to Kubernetes
- Sets up Redis and MongoDB for persistence

**Access your application:**
- Application: http://localhost:30001
- Swagger Documentation: http://localhost:30001/docs

**Use this when:**
- Deploying to production
- You want to version and host your Docker image
- Sharing your application with others
- Creating reproducible deployments

### 11. Clean Up Kubernetes Resources

When you're done testing, remove all created Kubernetes resources:

```bash
jac destroy main.jac
```

**What this does:**
- Deletes all Kubernetes deployments, services, and StatefulSets
- Removes persistent volumes and claims
- Cleans up the namespace (if custom namespace was used)


## Quick Start: Running Todo application with frontend
Follow these steps to set up and test the Todo application with frontend

### 1. Clone the Jaseci Repository

First, clone the main Jaseci repository which contains JAC and JAC-Scale:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaseci-labs/jaseci.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd jaseci
```

### 2. Create Python Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install JAC, JAC-Scale and JAC-Client

Install the packages in editable mode from the cloned repository:

```bash
pip install -e ./jac

pip install -e ./jac-client
```

### 5. Create Todo application using jac-client

Lets create the todo application using jac client.For that lets run following command

```bash
jac create_jac_app todo
```
Then lets copy the todo fully implemented jac code available inside jac-scale/examples/todo to our newly created /todo folder

```bash
cp jac-scale/examples/todo/app.jac todo/app.jac
cd todo
```

### 8. Run the Application with JAC Scale

To run your application run the following command

```bash
jac serve app.jac
```

**Access your application:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:8000/page/app
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- Swagger Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

you can add new todo tasks
 from the frontend at http://localhost:8000/page/app

## Deployment Modes

### Mode 1: Deploy Without Building (Default)

Deploys your JAC application to Kubernetes without building a Docker image.

```bash
jac scale main.jac
```

**Use this when:**
- You want faster deployments without rebuilding
- You're testing configuration changes
- You're in development mode

### Mode 2: Build, Push, and Deploy

Builds a new Docker image, pushes it to DockerHub, then deploys to Kubernetes.

```bash
jac scale main.jac -b
```

**Requirements for Build Mode:**
- A `Dockerfile` in your application directory
- Environment variables set:
  - `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Your DockerHub username
  - `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Your DockerHub password/access token

**Use this when:**
- Deploying to production
- You want to version and host your Docker image
- Sharing your application with others


## Important Notes

### Implementation

- The entire `jac scale` plugin is implemented using **Python and Kubernetes Python client libraries**
- **No custom Kubernetes controllers** are used → easier to deploy and maintain

### Database Provisioning

- Databases are created as **StatefulSets** with persistent storage
- Databases are **only created on the first run**
- Subsequent `jac scale` calls only update application deployments
- This ensures persistent storage and avoids recreating databases unnecessarily

### Performance

- **First-time deployment** may take longer due to database provisioning and image downloading
- **Subsequent deployments** are faster since:
  - Only the application's final Docker layer is pushed and pulled
  - Only deployments are updated (databases remain unchanged)

## Deployment Process

When you run `jac scale`, the following steps are executed:

### 1. Create JAC Application Docker Image

- Build the application image from the source directory
- Tag the image with DockerHub repository

### 2. Push Docker Image to DockerHub (Build Mode Only)

- Authenticate using `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
- Push the image to DockerHub
- Subsequent pushes are faster since only the final image layer is pushed

### 3. Deploy to Kubernetes

- Create or update Kubernetes namespace
- Deploy Redis and MongoDB (first run only)
- Create application deployment
- Create services and expose via NodePort

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Kubernetes cluster not accessible:**
- Ensure Kubernetes is running: `kubectl cluster-info`
- Check your kubeconfig: `kubectl config view`

**DockerHub authentication fails:**
- Verify your `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` are correct
- Ensure you're using an access token (not password) if 2FA is enabled

**Namespace doesn't exist:**
- The plugin creates namespaces automatically
- If using a custom namespace, ensure proper permissions

**Database connection issues:**
- Verify StatefulSets are running: `kubectl get statefulsets -n <namespace>`
- Check pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>`
- Ensure persistent volumes are bound: `kubectl get pvc -n <namespace>`

**Application not accessible:**
- Check service exposure: `kubectl get svc -n <namespace>`
- Verify NodePort is not blocked by firewall
- For Minikube, use: `minikube service <service-name> -n <namespace>`

**Build failures:**
- Ensure Dockerfile exists in your application directory
- Check Docker daemon is running
- Verify sufficient disk space for image building

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check pod status: `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`
2. View pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>`
3. Describe resources: `kubectl describe <resource-type> <resource-name> -n <namespace>`
