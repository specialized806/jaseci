# Jaseci Ecosystem

Welcome to the Jaseci project. This repository houses the core libraries and tooling for building next-generation applications with the Jac programming language.

Jaseci serves as the implementation stack for the Jac programming language, and is packaged as a simple Python library. This runtime stack enables Jac code to execute with its enhanced features while maintaining the seamless Python interoperability that makes the language particularly accessible to Python developers.

The project brings together a set of components that work seamlessly together:

- **[`jaclang`](jac/):** The Jac programming language, a drop‚Äëin replacement for and superset of Python.
- **[`byllm`](jac-byllm/):** Plugin for Jac enabling easy integration of large language models into your applications.
- **[`jac-cloud`](jac-cloud/):** Plugin for Jac with cloud‚Äënative utilities that automatically turn a Jac application into a production-ready server stack.
- **[`jac VSCE`](jac/support/vscode_ext):** The official VS¬†Code extension for Jac.

## Core Concepts

Jac is an innovative programming language that extends Python's semantics while maintaining full interoperability with the Python ecosystem. It introduces cutting-edge programming models and abstractions specifically designed to hide complexity, embrace AI-forward development, and automate categories of common software systems that typically require manual implementation. Despite being relatively new, Jac has already proven its production-grade capabilities, currently powering several real-world applications across various use cases. Jaseci's power is rooted in four key principles.


* **AI-Native:** Treat AI models as a native type. Weave them into your logic as effortlessly as calling a function with first-class AI abstractions.

* **Agentic Object-Spatial Programming Model:** Model your domain as a graph of objects and deploy agentic **walker** objects to travel through your object graph performing operations in-situ. Intuitively model AI state, the problem domain, and data.

* **Python Superset:** Use the entire Python ecosystem (`pip`, `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.) without friction. All valid Python code is also valid Jac code, ensuring a gentle learning curve.

* **Cloud-Native:** Deploy your application as a production-ready API server with a single `jac serve` command, scaling from local prototype development to a distributed cloud environment with zero code changes.

## Installation & Setup

<details>
<summary><strong>Install from PyPI (Recommended)</strong></summary>

<br>

Get the complete, stable toolkit from PyPI:
```bash
pip install jaclang[all]
```
This is the fastest way to get started with building applications.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Install from Source (For Contributors)</strong></summary>

<br>

If you plan to contribute to Jaseci, install it in editable mode from a cloned repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jaseci-Labs/jaseci.git
cd jaseci
```
This will install all development dependencies, including testing and linting tools.

</details>


## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The `jac` CLI is your primary interface for interacting with the Jaseci ecosystem.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`jac run <file.jac>`** | Executes a Jac file, much like `python3`. |
| **`jac build <file.jac>`** | Builds a self-contained Jac application from a source file. |
| **`jac serve <file.jac>`** | Executes a Jac file to the cloud. |
