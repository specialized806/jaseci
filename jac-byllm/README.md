# byLLM : Prompt Less, Smile More!

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/byllm.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/byllm/) [![tests](https://github.com/jaseci-labs/jaseci/actions/workflows/test-jaseci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jaseci-labs/jaseci/actions/workflows/test-jaseci.yml) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Join%20Server-blue?logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/6j3QNdtcN6)

byLLM is an innovative AI integration framework built for the Jaseci ecosystem, implementing the cutting-edge Meaning Typed Programming (MTP) paradigm. MTP revolutionizes AI integration by embedding prompt engineering directly into code semantics, making AI interactions more natural and maintainable. While primarily designed to complement the Jac programming language, byLLM also provides a powerful Python library interface.

Installation is simple via PyPI:

```bash
pip install byllm
```

## Basic Example

Consider building an application that translates english to other languages using an LLM. This can be simply built as follows:

```python
import from byllm.lib { Model }

glob llm = Model(model_name="gpt-4o");

def translate_to(language: str, phrase: str) -> str by llm();

with entry {
    output = translate_to(language="Welsh", phrase="Hello world");
    print(output);
}
```

This simple piece of code replaces traditional prompt engineering without introducing additional complexity.

## Power of Types with LLMs

Consider a program that detects the personality type of a historical figure from their name. This can eb built in a way that LLM picks from an enum and the output strictly adhere this type.

```python
import from byllm.lib { Model }
glob llm = Model(model_name="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash");

enum Personality {
    INTROVERT, EXTROVERT, AMBIVERT
}

def get_personality(name: str) -> Personality by llm();

with entry {
    name = "Albert Einstein";
    result = get_personality(name);
    print(f"{result} personality detected for {name}");
}
```

> Similarly, custom types can be used as output types which force the LLM to adhere to the specified type and produce a valid result.

## Control! Control! Control!

Even if we are elimination prompt engineering entierly, we allow specific ways to enrich code semantics through **docstrings** and **semstrings**.

```python
"""Represents the personal record of a person"""
obj Person {
    has name: str;
    has dob: str;
    has ssn: str;
}

sem Person.name = "Full name of the person";
sem Person.dob = "Date of Birth";
sem Person.ssn = "Last four digits of the Social Security Number of a person";

"""Calculate eligibility for various services based on person's data."""
def check_eligibility(person: Person, service_type: str) -> bool by llm();

```

Docstrings naturally enhance the semantics of their associated code constructs, while the `sem` keyword provides an elegant way to enrich the meaning of class attributes and function arguments. Our research shows these concise semantic strings are more effective than traditional multi-line prompts.

## How well does byLLM work?

byLLM is built using the underline priciple of Meaning Typed Programming and we shown our evaluation data compared with two such AI integration frameworks for python, such as DSPy and LMQL. We show significant performance gain against LMQL while allowing on par or better performance to DSPy, while reducing devloper complexity upto 10x.
