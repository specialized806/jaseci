"""Category 1: Named Imports - Test fixture for import pattern validation.

This fixture tests the following patterns from the proposal:
1. Single named import: import { useState } from 'react'
2. Multiple named imports: import { a, b, c } from 'lib'
3. Named import with alias: import { foo as bar } from 'lib'
"""

    # Single named import
    import from react { useState }

    # Multiple named imports
    import from lodash { map, filter, reduce }

    # Named import with alias
    import from axios { get as httpGet }

    # Mixed named imports and aliases
    import from vue { createApp, ref as reactive, computed }

    # Relative path imports
    import from .utils { helper }
    import from ..lib { formatter as format }
