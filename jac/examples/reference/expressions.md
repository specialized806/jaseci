Expressions in Jac form the computational backbone of the language, providing a rich hierarchy of operations that combine values, variables, and function calls into meaningful computations. Jac's expression system extends Python's familiar syntax while adding unique features for data spatial programming and enhanced type safety.

#### Expression Hierarchy

Jac expressions follow a well-defined precedence hierarchy:

1. **Conditional expressions**: Ternary conditional operations
2. **Lambda expressions**: Anonymous function definitions
3. **Concurrent expressions**: Flow and wait operations
4. **Walrus assignments**: Named expressions with `:=`
5. **Pipe expressions**: Forward and backward piping
6. **Bitwise operations**: Bit manipulation operations
7. **Logical operations**: Boolean logic and comparisons
8. **Arithmetic operations**: Mathematical computations
9. **Connect expressions**: Data spatial connections
10. **Atomic expressions**: Basic values and references

#### Basic Expression Types

```jac
42                    # Integer literal
"hello world"        # String literal
user_name            # Variable reference
calculate(x, y)      # Function call
result = value if condition else alternative;  # Conditional expression
```

#### Data Spatial Expression Integration

Expressions integrate seamlessly with data spatial constructs:

```jac
walker DataProcessor {
    can analyze with entry {
        neighbors = [-->];
        connected_count = len(neighbors);
        next_node = neighbors[0] if neighbors else None;
        
        if connected_count > threshold {
            visit neighbors.filter(lambda n: Node : n.is_active());
        }
    }
}
```

#### Type-Safe Expression Evaluation

```jac
let count: int = items.length();
let ratio: float = total / count;
let is_valid: bool = (count > 0) and (ratio < 1.0);
```

#### Performance Considerations

- Left-to-right evaluation for same precedence operations
- Short-circuit evaluation for logical operators
- Constant folding for literal expressions
- Type specialization for performance

Expressions provide the foundation for all computational operations in Jac, supporting both traditional programming patterns and data spatial algorithms while maintaining type safety and performance optimization.
